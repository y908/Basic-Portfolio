	Hello person on the internet reading my "About Me" page. Thank you for taking an interest in me! Hmm, what to say. Well, I'm new to web development but I'm a practiced artist. I've explored different ways to create visual art by using video media, painting, and sculpture. Now I'm cracking my knuckles and learning how to work with code. So far, it's been a familiar experience to art-making. You first start with nothing and slowly magic starts to happen! 
<br>
	Check out the things I've made in my portfolio. If you are WOWed by something, contact me! I'd love to hear your feedback. 
<br>
	Have an awesome day!
